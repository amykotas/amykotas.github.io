{"name":"Amy Kotas","tagline":"Designer + Developer","body":"### Hi, I'm Amy.\r\nI’m a graphic designer and web developer with several years of experience in print (publications, advertising). Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and getting up to speed with JS/JQuery, PHP, and CMS such as WordPress. I have a background in the liberal arts and I am a voracious lifelong learner.\r\n\r\nI'm currently taking the Freelance Wordpress Developer Blueprint at [Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com), and loving every minute of it.\r\n\r\nIt's my goal to design and develop websites, and printed media, for creative entrepreneurs, bloggers, and small businesses. I'm also interested in remote part-time and contract positions in web development. In either case, please contact me and let's have a chat.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not working out design solutions, searching Google Fonts, taking online classes, chasing my children around, or drinking coffee (_if you're buying:_ light roast, cream, no sugar)—I'm probably asleep. _Shhh_.\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\nSee my code at GitHub: @amykotas, or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amykotas). There's also [email](mailto:hello@amykotas.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
